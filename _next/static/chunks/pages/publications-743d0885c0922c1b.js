We demonstrate that the implementation is highly efficient and scalable, outperforming established planewave codes by more than an order of magnitude in minimum time to solution, with increasing advantages as the system size and/or number of processors is increased.

Increased structural complexity and a quasi-2D nature complicate the study of extended defects in MoS2. To address this knowledge gap, coordination-dependent atomic fingerprints are advanced for undercoordinated atoms in TMDs, enabling the cataloging of nanopore isomers in MoS₂. Combining the introduced fingerprints with extensive density functional theory calculations of etching energies, stochastic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of defect formation, and chemical graph theory for distinguishing nanopore shapes, predicts the most probable nanopores in MoS₂. A range of size-dependent topologies are revealed from elongated to perfectly triangular, where smaller defects are irregular, while larger ones are more symmetric, exhibiting qualitative agreement with experiments. Moving toward a sulfur-rich chemical environment slows down the growth of larger pores and makes them perfectly triangular, providing an experimental route to control nanopore synthesis. The size-dependent structural order in MoS₂ nanopores elucidated here will enable precise control over the defect shape and size distribution in the material for various application areas, including seawater desalination, gas separations, DNA sequencing, and optoelectronic devices."},{"title":"Role of Chemical Etching in the Nucleation of Nanopores in 2D MoS₂: Insights from First-Principles Calculations","authors":"Sayan Bhowmik, Jamie H.

In such applications, defects and nanopores play a key role in modulating the 2D material’s physicochemical properties, e.g., the band gap, chemical reactivity, catalytic activity, and molecular/ionic permeation rate. However, there exists a lack of a fundamental understanding of nanopore formation in TMDs, especially MoS₂. In this work, we elucidate the mechanism of nanopore formation in 2D MoS₂ using an extensive set of first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We calculate the energies of etching of atoms using DFT and use Marcus theory for atom-transfer reactions to convert the energies to activation barriers. We postulate the role of silicon as an etchant and show that the MoS₆ vacancy can be a potential nucleation site for the growth of nanopores in MoS₂. By fitting our kinetic predictions to experimental microscopy data on the formation time of a MoS₆ vacancy, we show that the intrinsic barrier for the etching of atoms in MoS₂, as described by Marcus theory, is 0.228 eV in the presence of silicon atoms. We find that the slowest step in the formation of the MoS₆ vacancy is the step leading from a S₅ vacancy to a S₆ vacancy, with an activation barrier of ∼0.85 eV. This allows atoms to be etched at close to room-temperature conditions (27 \xb0C) under the action of an electron beam that can move around the silicon etchant atoms. Using this new understanding of the nanopore formation process, researchers will be able to accurately model the controlled fabrication of nanopores in 2D MoS₂."},{"title":"Chemical vapor deposition of 2D materials: A review of modeling, simulation, and machine learning studies","authors":"Sayan Bhowmik, Ananth Govind Rajan; iScience (2022)","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2022.103832","link":"https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)00102-X","image":"cvd_review_iscience.jpg","abstract":"Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is extensively used to produce large-area two-dimensional (2D) materials.

Herein, we survey the vast literature regarding modeling and simulation of the CVD growth of 2D materials and their heterostructures. We also focus on newer materials, such as silicene, phosphorene, and borophene.

The isotherm models were employed to test the adsorption isotherm data. The Langmuir model showed the best fit among the models for both of the adsorbents. The pseudo-second-order model characterized the kinetic behaviour for both of the adsorbents. The thermodynamic results implied that the process was exothermic.
